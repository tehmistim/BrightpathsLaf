                            At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Tim started a podcast called "intersections(IPE)."  The purpose of the podcast was to help other small businesses share their audiences with the huge following that POLISHED by:Full Attention to Detail built over near a decade.  Tim felt this would be true b2b networking where the audience learns the genuine side of each guest on the show.

Technology is the future and Tim's heavy background in a technical field will be a great asset to any company that signs him on.
